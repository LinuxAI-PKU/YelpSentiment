H83uIqLKcOSFcmJhXmc-lA,3/20/2012,ZaGj97PSMZVs1dvvTPfOzw,1,"I would give this place NO STARS but Yelp! wants me to give at least one. I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and next to our awful Bucca di Beppo (Scottsdale) experience, I have to say, this one is on my list of MOST TERRIBLE restaurant experiences. The service was so bad, we didn't even get to try the food! True Yelper that I am, I did my homework before suggesting that we come here for dinner. I saw all the reviews about the ""bad service"" , but I paid more attention to the ""Cheap"" and  ""Delicious Pho"" reviews because after all, you can't knock it til you've tried it. Yes, the place looks as divey as any food dive gets, yes the place isn't as clean as it probably can be, but hey, all the best pho I've  had (Da Vang, Khai Hoan, Pho Thanh) has been from some of the diviest pho spots in town.  I was excited. It was around 6pm and the place wasn't busy (there were 5 other customers besides us, and 3 of them were on their way out), so we went ahead and sat ourselves down. The server gave us menus, and made her way back behind the cash register. After looking over the menu for less than 2 minutes (I usually go for the spring rolls + everything pho whenever I visit a new spot), we were ready to order. I tried to make eye contact with our server but she seemed to be preoccupied with laughing and talking with the pre-teen sitting behind the counter with her. I finally made eye contact with her, she looked at me and I looked at her, and she turned back to her conversation. For the next 15 minutes I tried to get her attention to alert her that we were ready to order - no luck. But then I noticed that both her and the girl she was talking to were looking over at us and laughing, occasionally pointing in our direction and laughing some more. I wasn't about to give up because I was determined to try some of their well-reviewed food, but after a quarter of an hour spent trying to get their attention with them just laughing and pointing at us, my boyfriend and I had enough. The way they treated us was disrespectful and humiliating, so we walked out and drove across town to another Vietnamese restaurant. We are never going back to this restaurant, and I suggest you don't either. Just as it isn't acceptable for customers to be rude to restaurant staff, it also isn't okay for restaurant staff to be blatantly rude to customers who have not done anything to deserve bad treatment. We did not deserve the type of treatment we got at this restaurant and I am seriously fuming with anger as I write this review. I don't care how delicious and cheap your food is, you cannot use that as an excuse to make customers who come in feel like somehow they are undeserving individuals. Thanks, but no thanks, Pho House. I don't need to feel disrespected and belittled just so I can try your cheap Vietnamese food. I have plenty of Vietnamese friends who have moms who can probably cook better than you can and will treat us a million times better than your staff did last night.",review,ci9mK1xSTvNCO8H2LYiAjA,1,3,2

I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again. However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory. We were seated immediately. Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is). Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls. When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us.I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily.

Bottom line, the hotel's free breakfast tasted better than this and we got better service there. We arrived around 945am on a Sunday morning and had to wait around seven minutes to be seated. The staff was pleasant enough. We were seated, given menus with water and she took our order for coffee and the breakfast special (loaded potato skillet). We sat for 15 minutes before we saw our waitress again. She finally figured out she forgot to bring our coffee. We finally got some coffee which was mediocre in flavor. Our food arrived about ten minutes after that. The skillet was supposed to contain sausage, bacon, onion, scrambled eggs, grilled american potatoes covered with cheese and sour cream. Mine had no bacon, two tiny chunks of sausage, no cheese, and the potatoes were so soggy, they tasted like someone had thawed them and thrown them in as an afterthought. It was so unpalatable i could not eat more than one bite, even after loading it up with salt and hot sauce. The waitress never checked on us once during the meal. She came back by the time my husband was finished. I told her the meal was horrible (in a nice way). She offered me something else. By that point, I was not feeling like eating anything else, I felt kinda sick. My meal was comped and we did get an apology. The manager explained that everyone LOVES that special and the potatoes are seasoned and grilled. The cook obviously didn't try my potatoes. Blech.

The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.  The limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.On entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.  There are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!When I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of ""I am the only staffperson here...""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception. 6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.Staffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.  6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.  6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.  6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated ""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have ""The Best Curry in the Valley"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.

It was increasingly obvious that the staff was hostile and irritated that they could not close up early. We finished our last call drinks and started to head out.

As he was carried backwards he lost his balance and tumbled back with both bouncers on top of him. The bouncers slammed him down headfirst on the cement outside of the establishment, pinned him down with their elbows and hit him. At this point I had run behind the bouncers and was yelling at them to get off of him. I had already taken out my phone to call 911 and I quickly tried to take a picture to show that they were using excessive force. We demanded to see the manager at which point the bouncer said he was the manager and refused our request. He swiped my friend's phone down out of his hand and broke it on the ground. Several people had called 911 at this point and we waited outside for the police to arrive. The police arrived and took down the bouncers' information and stated that they would be recording this incident. I am absolutely adamant in saying that neither I nor my friends will ever frequent Loco Patron again. We were treated disrespectfully by untrained staff who were either too eager to close up to get home or get a power high by manhandling non threatening, non physical patrons of their establishment. Based on the behavior of the two bouncers I assume that this bar operates without any written guidelines on how bouncers should conduct themselves. What I witnessed was full on assault and an infringement on human rights and I plan on writing any regulatory agency I can think of. These people make a bad name for all of the bouncers out there that conduct themselves within the guidelines of the law.",review,sRMG12fVSNEV3v--hxv70Q,0,0,0

It's not the same anymore.We went for my wife's 30th birthday.  My dad decided to join us.  My wife ordered steak and shrimp, my dad ordered steak, I ordered a crab stuffed lobster.  I have had the crab stuffed lobster many times before.  I was craving it.We got our appetizer's.  Dad got snails, wife and I shared steamers.  My dad was happy with the snails.  But then again, how can you go wrong with snails doused in garlic and butter?  The steamers were steamed little neck clams in a garlic broth.  It was not long neck clams like the rest of the world calls steamers.  I wasn't about to argue with the server that these are the wrong clams.The food came and for the first time in my life I was asking the server to take back my meal before I even tried it.  It looked dry and over cooked.  I told the server I've had this dish many times before and this is not the way it's supposed to be.  He told me this is what it's supposed to look like and begged me to try it.  I took one bite and I couldn't even swallow it because it was so dry.  Of course the server was gone by this point and didn't come back for 10 minutes to ask me how it was.While I was waiting for the server to return, I told my family I was just going to get the steak.  They just shook their head and told me not to.  I took one bite of my dad's steak and spat it out.  How do you screw up steak this bad?  It tasted like beef jerky and butter.  My dad and wife would have complained too, but it's my wife's birthday and I am already stealing her thunder.  I swapped my meal out for a steamed lobster.  How do you screw up a steamed 1 1/2 lobster?  Fortunately, that came out fine.So we left hungry and $300 poorer.  I used to not mind paying the money they charged but now, it is not worth it.  I am really hoping people stop coming here so they can just close down.",review,KcI2VGSvRhLAmw6vZrc8WQ,4,8,3

I couldn't eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.

I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat.

We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular ""Chinese"" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.Our ""Har Gow""/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.The trademark ""beef internal organs"" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon. The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too. I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.",review,e9HWnHUYlt9758oileaISw,0,2,1

When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, ""not too long."" We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began. Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours. After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time. I don't recommend going to Macayos.

Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a ""sorry"" from the staff. I could smell that the fish had gone horribly, horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter, and I'm shocked that the kitchen actually thought they'd get away with sending it out. The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food, and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say, ""okay, we all smelled it and there's definitely something wrong there.""Seriously? You had to go pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell? After all this, their solution was to comp an appetizer, not the salad, and eventually gave me a new salad to go, which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side. Look, I'm not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I don't really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants, but this could have been dangerous.

It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but won't split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote ""family style"".  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive, not everyone at the table ate it and when served ""family style"" someone else may get what you ordered and you won't have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill, SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was ""this is our company policy, we do not split checks for large parties"".  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill, I'm pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I don't normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks, at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.

The option to pick up wine at the Public Market next door and have the already reasonable corkage fee waived was a bonus, as we had really enjoyed a couple of the Arizona Stronghold wines at a recent FnB wine pairing and thought they would pair well with the Jamaican heat! While the scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly, 2 for $12.50 -- $6.25 per scallop -- is a tad steep in my book. We also shared the Jerk Chicken Salad ($9.95) and the Jerk Prawns Off the Grill ($14.95). Here's the ultimate rub, the bottom of the menu states ""no substitutions or modifications""... Since when is cutting a KFC-side-sized ear of corn a ""modification""? At the same time, the menu describes the restaurant and it's offerings as ""Nothing fancy; simply good food that nourishes and rejuvenates the body."" It seems like cutting something in half so we could easily share it -- particularly after the plate has been delivered to the table for us to appreciate it's ""beauty"" AND after we've communicated to our server and demonstrated with the first two courses that we were splitting the items -- is in the vein of ""nothing fancy."" How about providing the customer with an appropriate utensil to cut it themselves, then? The fact that the chef was obstinate in refusing to cut the KFC-side-sized ear of corn provided with our entree screams ""pretentious and grandiose"" and tainted our entire experience. To quote my dinning companion, ""You are not James Beard and James Beard would've cut the corn!""",review,vsXP832M0kOxKpfduD7dWw,10,13,10

We should've just turned around right then but decided to stay... then on top of that we were sat next to some drunk beligerent people spilling and flirting with there server (wich you could tell made her uncomfotable) that table were continuosly getting over served beers. Since there was not one mgr in sight the little time we were one of my boys stepped in and there was almost a fight right then and there.. putting that aside our service was horrible some dude was our server and we went without seeing him for like 30 min and not so cold beers. At that point after one round of drinks we decided not to order food and the table next to us was gripeing about there food so that was another sign to get the F out of there so we paid (once the server got back) then bolted. I wasn't going to yelp anything BUT I just received my checking statement and the dude added 5 to his 3 dollar tip. I gave the guy 3 on $12 he was lucky to have even gotten that.

We heard only great things about this place and wanted to experience their 'unforgettable' steak dishes. That, we did, unfortunately. The restaurant was lovely dim-lit, adequate atmosphere for an expensive steak place. We were seated immediately and tended to by the waiting staff.

Our waiter told us about the daily specials, after which we ordered food and wine. After a short wait, four large dinner plates arrived. I was the lucky one, my steak (a large  rib eye steak, ordered medium-rare which tasted very good despite two large blobs of fat) was sitting pretty in the middle of the large dinner plate. Nothing else on my plate, just the steak.

We asked our waiter for a side dish, mashed potatoes with Parmesan, and when they arrived, we couldn't believe it! There were no more than two scraggly potatoes turned into mashed potatoes, or about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes per person. Mind you, they tasted good, but at over $9.00 per side dish?

There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite.

Why waste money on places that won't take it! I won't return and will recommend my friends don't either!",review,QzA6ZW1NFid32_g_fsapIg,0,1,0

There was literally dried smeared feces on the toilet seat and the floor looked like it had never been washed.  Of course the restroom cleaning check-list was not initialed the entire day. Oh...I almost forgot there were no paper towels to dry my hands.  I told one of the employess and he says ""I know dude"".  It's rediculous that the bathroom looks like this when you have 10 employess standing around with their thumbs up their asses gossiping. Burger was over-priced.  Milkshake was ok.  Also no napkins anywhere in sight on the tables or at the bar area.  Apparently napkins are something you have to ask for?  Whoever owns this place needs to get a better manager at this facility, because he is loosing money with all of the one-time customers who will choose to go somehwere else next time.",review,We7ULac-q9TAWOhiSozzrQ,0,0,0
TMdHhDI7jYQ9206dtvrBgA,10/5/2009,egj6lfYCfSrkcrIPYw3C-g,1,"AWFUL.  Not sure it classifies as food.  Burrito consists of a flour tortilla and meat.  No salsa, beans, cheese, sour cream, guacamole.  Nada.  Plus they won't let you add anything to it.  Everything is as is.  The cheese enchalada had cheese but it was not gooey and melted.  The food was barely luke warm.   Service is also mediocre.  The salsa was gross.  It was super water down.  The best part of the meal was my Pepsi.",review,NsIoM2PlaL28E-jbrs4Zlw,1,1,1

It really deserves NO STARS!!!You can only like this place if you don't know anything about Vietnamese food. What I tried...Bun Bo Hue:  Broth didn't even taste like Bun Bo Hue.  Spicy but has no flavor.  Where's the beef shank or hog's feet?  You can't have Bun Bo Hue without the shank or hog's feet.  They use the cheapest cuts of meat.  This item was on their Daily Special.  Pho Chin Nam:  The broth was super sweet.  You know what that means....MSG galore!!!!  Not even a hint of Anise star in the broth.  How can you specialize in Pho if you can't even make the broth taste right?Service stinks.  I hate it when the waiter holds the bowl in such a way that his thumb is on the inside of the bowl while serving it.  The dude never refill the water, ask how things were, etc.Vegetable platter was not fresh.  Bean sprouts were starting to brown. If you can't cook something why even bother serving it to customers.  I don't know about other entrees they offer but I won't be coming back to find out.  This has to be one of the worse Vietnamese restaurant in the valley. Check out my extensive list of Vietnamese Restaurants for suggestions to better ones.",review,s7Tm9oYWqRlBm5ex2OQ1nw,1,1,2

The spinach artichoke dip was just okay - a bit on the dry side and not very cheesy. The onion rings were just okay was well as the batter reminded me of the chicken nuggets at McDonald's, maybe even worse. The BBQ burger (turkey patty) was dry and tasteless as was the bacon. Really? It must take true talent to cook bacon tasteless. There are a few things that the menu has going for itself - a few very unique and fun desserts and drinks that I have yet to see elsewhere. I am fond of the giant pile of cotton candy and, though I'm not much of a beer drinker, the beer tower looks pretty badass.For me, I came and will continue to come for the fun atmosphere, but I will definitely be staying away from the grub. Adios, cowboy.",review,yhGfcKunPjcy-v-1ppr6oQ,0,2,0
