1M4oczf2lmkdgbrJ3J7OqA,7/25/2011,cgC-Oeigl6MhXZPq6jlNPg,1,"The food was decent, however I am writing about their underhanded business practices.I ordered a travelzoo voucher for $69 that included 2 3 course meals. It said ""Regularly $140"". What we ordered, if had been ordered off the regular menu would have been about $100. However, we were charged tax on the full $140. Second, even though on the voucher it says ""PLEASE TIP ON THE FULL VALUE OF THE CHECK."" (which implies tip is not included and we get to choose the tip amount) and nowhere mentions automatic gratuity, 18% gratuity (18% of $140, even though we ordered $100 worth of food at the most) was automatically added to our check.Third, even if you had ordered the most expensive options, the highest possible amount it could be worth is $120, not $140. It is mathematically impossible to have the voucher be a $140 value, but that is what they add tax and tip to.Fourth, after we told our waiter we were using a voucher, he seemed less interested in the service level of our table, which i later realized was because he had a guaranteed 18% (of $140) tip.I just noticed today they have another travelzoo deal ""$79 - AWARD-WINNING FRENCH DINNER FOR 2 W/WINE, REG. $165"", I am posting this so hopefully if anyone is thinking of buying that voucher, they will read this first before they purchase it.",review,FvUWCfM4ZcVVhf8Wq4R4nA,1,13,3

Ez2MFsVT5lJZ05yvK_0AXQ,7/26/2009,E0ACkDa9jkFodlILiOcYmA,1,"I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night. Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade. However, this is where the pleasanties end.Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off.

I'm not disappointed easily, but I've given this place three chances to impress and they've consistently disappointed.   I live nearby and was very excited for a new, trendy place to eat & drink. The first time we went there, we sat at the ""outside"" bar. The male bartender was not personable at all-he was actually quite rude. When I politely asked him if he knew the price of a liquor off the top of his head (and not to worry about it if he didn't, I was just curious), he snottily replied with, ""well, there's not a button for it so I don't know."" He then rolled his eyes and walked away. I was astounded at how rude he was but shrugged it off. I actually felt bad because I thought somehow I offended or embarrassed him because he didn't know the price of this particular liquor, so I apologized to him, and he proceeded to made another smart comment about how he charged me the well price but that the next time I come in it might be much higher, again being very snotty and rude. My boyfriend was actually pretty upset at the way he spoke to me but chose to let it go because we just aren't the type if people to be confrontational or to complain.  After our meal and about an hour before close, he told us he was leaving and that another girl would be taking care of us. When she showed up all she did was clean the bar in preparation to close (even though that wasn't for another hour) and didn't even introduce herself or say hello. I waited for her to notice that my boyfriend's Blue Moon was empty but she was too busy cleaning so I asked her myself. She asked me what beer he was drinking, I told her, then watched her pour the wrong beer and give it to me as if I wouldn't notice. (Not all alcohol is available at that side of the bar. For instance Blue Moon and the liquor I was drinking are stored at the main bar, another point of annoyance for the original, rude male bartender. But how is that my fault? I didn't know that.  And clearly this girl didn't feel like going to the other bar to pour the correct beer for my boyfriend, even though she specifically asked me which beer he was drinking and then lazily poured whatever wheat beer they had in tap at the bar we were sitting at.) That was the ""straw that broke the camel's back"" for me. We paid out and went to Darcy McGees (in the same shopping center) where the staff are always pleasant and helpful.We have since given the Lion two more tries but been severely disappointed with the service. The food is excellent- but just cannot make up for the terrible service. The second time we tried this place we sat at the main bar (as to not inconvenience the bartender at the outside bar), and all of the bartenders were too busy talking amongst themselves to notice that both of us were empty on drinks and hungry with no menus offered to us. I'm sorry to say that we won't be giving this place another shot.",review,MKUv9aV4Aq6fmNeFHQjqPQ,1,5,3

When I decided to call and tell Chompies this has to be the 10th or 12 time in a row they have screwed up our order. This was more than screwing up a order. This was forgetting the soup in SOUP. They told me if I wanted the broth I should have asked for it in a separate container. I responded I didn't think I had to ask for broth in soup! I WILL NEVER GIVE THEM A DIME OF MY MONEY AGAIN.  I highly recommend to drive the additional 15-20 minutes in your car and find somewhere else when looking for jewish comfort food. You will be highly disappointed with Chompies.

7UZQ6qGX8lP7a3jokfYVjQ,3/28/2011,ysXcFqnWNQ33d_Qh0-cClw,1,"Totally excited to try this place out, my grandparents, my mom and I (4 of us) came here for some Korean food. It wasn't too busy; just pairs of people from nearby offices coming in and out. Unlike other Korean restaurants, their lunch special selection is very limited. Special A  consists of a sushi roll with a soda, special B = teriyaki beef/chicken (no soda), or special C, Korean BBQ Spicy Chicken. As we were looking at the ""lunch special"" board, the lady behind the counter insisted that we should look at their full price menu instead. Here comes the awkward part: she then asked my mom ""are you Chinese?"" Even though she is, my mum looked at me all puzzled as in ""what does that mean?"" The lady proceeded by pointing at the ""seafood pancake"" section on the menu and saying ""I don't know why but you Chinese like this pancake a lot."" Good thing my mom didn't hear what she said.. or else... So we got the Spicy Chicken lunch special ($6.99), a bulgogi ($6.99), and a beef yakisoba ($7.19). The cool thing about this place is that it has a mini ""kimchi"" buffet bar, with trays of marinated tofu, potato, bean sprout, kimchi, broccoli and some other vegetables. It also has this delicious house special hot sauce. By the time we finished a dish of kimchi, the food came, so it didn't take long. The spicy chicken, came in a bowl about the size of an instant-noodle bowl (but slightly deeper), was tender, with rice underneath it. The chicken was definitely marinated well; however, the last couple of pieces had tendons and big chunks of fat... what a bad way to end it. The bulgogi also came in a bowl, with rice underneath. The beef was definitely not marinated fully. The color was super light and the beef was close to tasteless. The biggest disappointment, food-wise, was the beef yakisoba. The noodles, occupying most of the Styrofoam lunch box, were sweet. Then there was an ice-cream scoop of rice, topped with 3 pieces, I kid you not, THREE pieces of dog-tag-sized, super-dry meat. In the end, we just decided to bring the barely-touched yakisoba home for my younger brother (well, teenage boys tend to eat everything...). While my mom transfered the noodles to the plastic bowl (since the Styrofoam box was lidless), I went to ask for a plastic cover. This is the best part: the same lady, stared at me, pointed at the salad bar and said ""you can't take that home"". I thought there was a miscommunication, so I asked again for a lid for the noodles. Again, she pointed at the salad bar and said ""you are not allowed to take the kimchi home"". Wow seriously? Just b/c my grandparents are Chinese you assumed we were stashing kimchi in a bowl and trying to sneak it out? ""Look, I just want to take my noodles home, ok?"" She hesitantly gave me a lid.""Hey, hey you. we chineness peple no steal kimchi becuz Confucius say 'no stealing kimchi'""... only if I said that to her face...Oh, and when we got home, my brother, aka our food dumpster, took a bite of the yakisoba and never touched it again.  Conclusion: If you want amazing Korean food and friendly customer service, please just go to Chodang. Chodang is WAYYY BETTER, hands down",review,gnirIlRf-E9uBUZhRzvPzA,1,3,1

Unfortunately, this isn't one of those reviews. This is a fish story... No, not about the big one that got away. Nor is it about the time I was fly fishing with my dad and had to rescue him because he stepped in a deep hole and sank when his waders filled with water.... this is about the trout that saved the day.When my wife and I arrived at the Greene House, it was earlier in the evening, still happy hour, though we were there for dinner not appetizers. Checked-in with the hostess and were quoted a  quoted 30-45 minute wait for a table. We knew the place was popular so weren't upset with the wait as we were looking forward to a wonderful dinner.Went to the bar to order wine and that's when our disappointment started. We were sitting in plain view at the edge of the bar facing the entry and there were TWO bartenders,  In spite of this, in the 15 minutes we waited, occasionally waving and saying ""excuse me"" to get the bartenders' attention, we never even got so much as a Hi, and certainly not an opportunity to order a drink.I had only just told my wife I wasn't willing to wait another 15-30 minutes wine free when the hostess pleasantly surprised us by saying a table was ready. Our relief was short lived however.After being seated, it was approximately 5 minutes before our server came to the table. We ordered wine and water.Our wine and water came NINE minutes later... a total of over 30 minutes since we entered the restaurant before we received our first beverage.We skipped an appetizer, planning ahead for dessert, and for our entree ordered Rainbow Trout with a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.Approximately 15 minutes later, our SIDE of Truffle Parmesan Fries showed up... sans trout. When asked about the missing trout, she said it'd be a few more minutes because the kitchen was backed up. When asked why she brought the side of fries, she said she thought we wanted them first, a leap of logic that totally escaped us. When our server said she could take the fries back ""to keep them warm until our trout was ready"", my wife and I looked at each other in amazement and made a spontaneous decision that given we were now STARVING, our original side of fries would serve us better as a hot appetizer than as a reheated side with dinner.Finally, a few minutes after our Truffle Parmesan Fries were gone, our trout arrived. As I indicated in the begining, it saved the day. The fish was fresh, perfectly prepared and exceptional.As good as the trout was however, is wasn't good enough to make us ever return to the Greene House. There is no reason any customer should suffer through such slow and uninspired service when there are at least a dozen restaurants within a 2 mile radius of this one (much less dozens more throughout the Phoeniz metro area), that are SIGNIFICANTLY more enjoyable. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else",review,N-Hn3--2DO5HzvrNcRGRag,0,3,0

We asked to be seated in the bar since some of us wanted to watch the game.  No problems so far.Our waiter was really nice at first, but seemed flustered and as if he wasn't getting the help he needed to keep up with his tables.  I waited tables for 12 years and this guy was nearly literally scrambling to keep up, a sure sign of not enough help or lack of teamwork.  Of the two hostesses, ONE of them could have bothered to help him out by refilling water, tea and soda for us, but alas they did nothing.  We waited so long for drink refills that my husband got up and saw a pitcher of coke on the bar, so he poured himself a glass, which he was scolded for!  I could not believe it, I was shocked.  A guest should NEVER be treated this way.  If anything, someone should have apologized to my husband for not giving us what we needed for the meal. The chips were good, and they kept them coming, so props to them for that.  They are served with bean dip and salsa.  I liked the salsa a lot, not spicy enough for me, but a good amount and mixture of yummy stuff, including cilantro which I find many ""salsas"" don't even contain!  To me, it is not salsa without cilantro.  The teensy bowls of salsa they bring though need some rethinking.  They should either bring one per person or consider a bigger size.  It's only about 2 Tablespoons, and that aint much salsa (beware, some sides of rice and beans also come in these super tiny containers - three or four bites and it's gone)!  Anyhow, we ate tons of chips and salsa because the food took SO long to come out.  Our waiter sort of apologized for this by keeping us updated that it was actually coming.....someday.Our food came out a good 35-40 minutes after we ordered.  Sadly, two meals were completely missing in action and the two of us that ordered fajitas (which came out of the kitchen very cool, not even the slightest bit of heat from the iron skillet or the meat) had to wait at least 10 minutes for their tortillas, so they couldn't even eat what was at the table, which was getting cold.  After the two missing meals came out, one was the wrong meat, red meat instead of chicken.  More waiting...the table eats, minus one.  When everyone is nearly finished, the right chicken taco dish comes out.  It was delicious, but overpriced.  The chicken was nicely grilled and the tacos were served the way I like them, with a little bit of onions, more cilantro, lettuce, lime and pico de gallo.  They also came with cheese, but I don't like cheese on tacos.  They came on tiny little corn tortillas, which themselves were good, but way too small to make decent tacos that didn't fall apart.  Plus, I ran out of  the tortillas before my meat and other stuff was gone.Our waiter was really nice except for the scolding (I'm still floored by that), so I can't decide if he sucked or the place sucks, or maybe they both do...We definately won't be back.",review,g13P8XfDT5Zfcts4wai4-Q,0,0,0

The first time I went about a year ago, both the food and service were great.Second time, last May, I ordered the same dish and it was horrible.  Drowning in sauce.  But, at least the service was decent.Just went a third time and it will be my last.  Both the food and service were horrible.  Went for lunch, sat inside and it wasn't very busy.  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things, like taking our order to start.  Then, even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.  In the meantime, I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area, which is open, so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins.My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.  This is a shame, especially because there aren't many places in Phx that have vegan choices, but for the price you pay, I would expect a lot more.",review,xnjqnfOl_5JRq_mouPxEbA,0,0,0
xWlCgISVtozxCztPA4nGaQ,12/6/2011,bMIm2p_s_jgRsuSi3Xt5BA,1,Honestly I don't get it.  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed.,review,8-qt1pNsZVah5tr2JBQBrw,0,2,0

I usually get the same thing to start with, ceviche and pollo asado. Both are usually quite delicious, not this time.The ceviche had absolutely no flavor to it. As if the chef tried to make it as flavorless as possible. I did not finish it as it was not enjoyable in the least. Now for the tacos. Stale taco shells, dried and overcooked chicken, slopped on guac and no pico de gallo. The tacos were so bad I tried to rescue them by asking for pico de gallo, since they did not put any on, and then I was charged $1.00 extra. Of course, no manager was anywhere in sight. This place simply doesn't care. On the bright side, the margaritas and salsa are still good, but the chips were stale.Not only will I not return, but I can no longer recommend this place to businessmen from out of town. I see dozens of new business people every day who stay in Scottsdale and they always ask for Mexican food, and I've always said Cien Agaves. No more.",review,PwemCNJqvGerNZHbSSbmFA,0,3,0

I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine.",review,o3J4bMsi7t9gMCMjEd_4ew,0,1,0
